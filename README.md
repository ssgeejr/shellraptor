Dev Notes: 
The new stdout command set presently only supports select.  I would like to 
add the delete, update and create functionality at some point but that will
have to wait for now. My work load is beyond imagination. 
alias			Name of the database alias in the 
                                     conf/dbconf.xml file
password 		Supply a password if one is not provided in the 
                                     conf/dbconf.xml file
outputfile  		Path and file to save output to. Setting this tag 
                                     as 'stdout' will
			pipe the output directly to the command line
delimiter			Delimiter used to separate the results. -NO- 
                                     default is provided

                                     default is provided
silent			[true/false] Display connection, logging information. Used when the
			application is being called by external resources 
                                     and output needs
			to be piped to another file
